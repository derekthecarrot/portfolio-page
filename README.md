# My Portfolio

## Description
I built this in order to showcase my other projects that will come in the works. This will feature all other work I do that I'd like to be public. This has tested my HTML and CSS skills and I have tried to create my profile to be responsive as possible. I honestly had difficulties with designing the entire thing, but was able to overcome it by just putting time and effort in. I also put borders around most of my sections so I could get an understanding of how I was flexing a container.

## Credits

I received some help from both Alex Copley (https://github.com/Alex-Copley) and Daniel Peterman (https://github.com/DanielPeterman). They provided advice and a wireframe on how I can section out my content. (Wireframe: https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/view/Mb75f46af3d672875cafa9cac6b422b2b1628541024690#/page/eca2cda41c41484db80bbc2bdf195ea3)
I used MDN docs to assist me with learning flex properties and testing them. Source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-wrap
I used coolors to generate a color scheme that I liked. Source: https://coolors.co/6c756b-93acb5-96c5f7-a9d3ff-f2f4ff
